# Water Retention Calculation

This program calculates the amount of water that can be retained in a relief map represented by a list of non-negative integers. The integers in the list represent the heights of walls with a unit width of 1. The program determines the total number of square units of water that can be retained between the walls after rainfall.

## Function Signature

To calculate the amount of rainwater retained between the walls, use the following function:

```python
def rain(walls):
    # Implementation goes here
    pass

###Parameters
walls: A list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls. The ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not considered as walls and will not retain water.
```
